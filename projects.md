## here are interesting data projects in health that I'd like to do something about
 * I really like the work and approach that [Open Innovations](https://open-innovations.org/) do.
   * I'd like to emmulate their approach and technology stack in any training or personal projects that I do so [Luke Strange](https://open-innovations.org/search/?author=lstrange) was kind enough to point me to this overview of the [Open Innovations Platform](https://open-innovations.github.io/platform/)
   * Of particualr interest is the (Open Data Saves Lives) project.
   * I'd like to read more about the [open outcomes](ahttps://apperta.org/openOutcomes/) project as well. This may have some info under the [Apperta Foundation gitHub](https://github.com/AppertaFoundation), and the [Clinical Knowledge Manager /(CKM)](https://ckm.apperta.org/ckm/) also looks interesting.
   * can [news2](https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/projects/outputs/national-early-warning-score-news-2) parameters be usefully put into an app? Some of these are subjective, so digitising their definition might be useful. It'd take some validation though! 

### there was a lot of useful learning from #ldf2023 that might help with this, especially the hack at Aire Innovates
 * [openEHR](https://openehr.org/) which [Ian McNicoll](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianmcnicoll/) told me about, in particualr, see the [specifications](https://specifications.openehr.org/) section.
 * [SNOMED](https://www.snomed.org/)
 * [UKCore Hackathon materials](https://simplifier.net/guide/UKCore-Hackathon/)
 * [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core)
   * https://simplifier.net/HL7FHIRUKCoreR4/~guides
   * https://simplifier.net/guide/uk-core-implementation-guide?version=current
 * [Florence](https://florence.community/) (or Flo) text message based system for home blood pressure reporting (Ian McNicoll also told me about this).
   * background on [NHS home bp monitoring)[https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/clinical-policy/cvd/home-blood-pressure-monitoring/] 
   * I'd be interested in understanding if this could flow directed to an EHR - this could become a #project
   * Also, could this be integrated into the NHS App
   * could one create an app to capture BP reading from a machine (home or clinical) and push this through? it should be possible to do this with fewer transposition errors, and could be impletmented with the hundreds of thousands of un-connected monitors already in hospitals, clinics and peoples homes...
   * there is a [paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2021.543176/full) that shows PoC for this, and has made their code available as [BPimageTranscribe repo](https://github.com/cliffordlab/BPimageTranscribe)
