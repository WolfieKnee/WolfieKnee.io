After 17 years working on research and development of knee replacement devices, my redundancy from DePuy in September 2023 has provided me with the opportunity to consider my future career in healthcare technology. Over recent months I have had many great conversations, some with people I have known most or all of my life, and others with people I have only just met. These conversations have highlighted the importance of considering not only _what_ I do for work, but _why_ I do it. As we move into this period where Data & DHT will have significant societal impact, training is readily available to learn the new skills I need to support _what_ work I do. However, learning about _why_ I do that work is more of a personal exploration. This page is part of that personal exploration, and contains a collection of thoughs, ideas and potential projects that I feel I would highly motived to do, and interesting to work on.

## useful resources 
There was a lot of useful learning from #ldf2023 that might help with this, especially the hack at Aire Innovates. 
  * [SNOMED](https://www.snomed.org/) 
  * [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core)
  * https://simplifier.net/HL7FHIRUKCoreR4/~guides
  * https://simplifier.net/guide/uk-core-implementation-guide?version=current

There were also some groups using **Open resources**. I really like this approach and there are many advantages to working in the open wherever possible [citation needed!]. While I'm not working for any particular organisation, it is a great opportunity for me to expore the 'Open' sector and gives me some real material to work with:
  * Of particular interest is the [Open Data Saves Lives](https://opendatasaveslives.org/) project.
  * I'd like to read more about the [open outcomes](ahttps://apperta.org/openOutcomes/) project as well. This may have some info under the [Apperta Foundation gitHub](https://github.com/AppertaFoundation), and the [Clinical Knowledge Manager /(CKM)](https://ckm.apperta.org/ckm/) also looks interesting. 
  * [openEHR](https://openehr.org/) which [Ian McNicoll](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianmcnicoll/) told me about, in particualr, see the [specifications](https://specifications.openehr.org/) section.
  * [UKCore Hackathon materials](https://simplifier.net/guide/UKCore-Hackathon/)
