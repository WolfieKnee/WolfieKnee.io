### my PhD
  * I did a PhD at University of Nottingham and my thesis on [on Biomechanics of shaken baby syndrome](https://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/11217/) is public so if you want you can read it if you like. To do all the processing of experimental data, and then automate running of computational models I built a RedHat Linux server, learned Perl and Python and then realised that my MATLAB code was so slow that I re-wrote it all in C++... I'm looking for examples of all that code on (very) old backup DVDs at the moment, but I suspect it is Fugly!

### research work
I have co-authored a number of papers and conference pressentations - I'll put a list here...
