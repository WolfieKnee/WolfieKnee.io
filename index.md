  <ul>
  <li>I really like the work and approach that <a href = "https://open-innovations.org/">Open Innovations</a> do so I'd like to emmulate their approach and technology stack in any training or personal projects that I undertake. <a href="https://open-innovations.org/search/?author=lstrange">Luke Strange</a> was kind enough to point me to this overview of the <a href="https://open-innovations.github.io/platform/">Open Innovations Platform</a></li>
  <li>When it is a bit more ready I should redirect my personal url: <a href="davidwolfson.co.uk">davidwolfson.co.uk</a> to this, but for now it can stay pointing to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-wolfson-6149a38/">my LinkedIn profile</a></li>
  <li>I've now started to add some style and structure, with Lume. <a href="https://andy-bell.co.uk/">Andy Bell's site</a> might be a good inspiration for this.</li>
  </ul>  
  This <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#html">markdown guide</a> is helpful.
