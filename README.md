#A page for David Wolfson
A page to hold blog-like information and pointers to my digital portfolio. When it is a bit more ready I should redirect my [personal url:davidwolfson.co.uk](davidwolfson.co.uk) to this, but for now it can stay pointing to [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-wolfson-6149a38/)

## here is my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-wolfson-6149a38/ "LinkedIn")

## here are things to do with pivoting to a Digital (Health) Tech Career
### training and skills
 * https://northcoders.com/our-courses/coding-bootcamp

### resources 
 * Lume

## here are interesting data projects in health that I'd like to do something about
 * I really like the work and approach that [Open Innovations](https://open-innovations.org/) do.
   * I'd like to emmulate their approach and technology stack in any training or personal projects that I do so [Luke Strange](https://open-innovations.org/search/?author=lstrange) was kind enough to point me to this overview of the [Open Innovations Platform](https://open-innovations.github.io/platform/)
   * Of particualr interest is the (Open Data Saves Lives) project. 
 * [openEHR](https://openehr.org/) which [Ian McNicoll](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianmcnicoll/) told me about during a hack at Aire Innovates during the Leeds Digtial Festival 2023
 * [Florence](https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/featured-content/power-of-people/flo) (or Flo) text message based system for home blood pressure reporting (Ian McNicoll also told me about this).
   * I'd be interested in understanding if this could flow directed to an EHR.
   * Also, could this be integrated into the NHS App
   * could one create an app to capture BP reading from a machine (home or clinical) and push this through? it shoudl be possible to do this with fewer transposition errors, and could be impletmented with the hundreds of thousands of un-connected monitors already in hospitals, clinics and peoples homes...

## and here are things to do with past career

### my PhD and research work
  * I did a PhD at University of Nottingham and my thesis on [on Biomechanics of shaken baby syndrome](https://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/11217/) is public so if you want you can read it if you like. To do all the processing of experimental data, and then automate running of computational models I built a RedHat Linux server, learned Perl and Python and then realised that my MATLAB code was so slow that I re-wrote it all in C++... I'm looking for examples of all that code on (very) old backup DVDs at the moment, but I suspect it is Fugly!
