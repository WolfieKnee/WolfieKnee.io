A page to hold blog-like information and pointers to my career history and digital portfolio, hosted on [gitHub](https://github.com/WolfieKnee/).

<summary> my plan for this page:</summary>
- I really like the work and approach that [Open Innovations](https://open-innovations.org/) do so I'd like to emmulate their approach and technology stack in any training or personal projects that I undertake. [Luke Strange](https://open-innovations.org/search/?author=lstrange) was kind enough to point me to this overview of the [Open Innovations Platform](https://open-innovations.github.io/platform/)

- When it is a bit more ready I should redirect my [personal url: davidwolfson.co.uk](davidwolfson.co.uk) to this, but for now it can stay pointing to [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-wolfson-6149a38/)

- add some style and structure, possibly through Lume. [Andy Bell's site](https://andy-bell.co.uk/) might be a good inspiration for this.
