# David Wolfson
A page to hold blog-like information and pointers to my digital portfolio, hosted on [my gitHub](https://github.com/WolfieKnee/).
## my plan for this page:
a lot of this is inspired by [open innovations](https://open-innovations.org/)...
* when it is a bit more ready I should redirect my [personal url: davidwolfson.co.uk](davidwolfson.co.uk) to this, but for now it can stay pointing to [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-wolfson-6149a38/)
* turn the sections below into seperate pages - I need to find out how to then link to these on gitHub, which shouldn't be hard but isn't important just now
* add some style and structure. possibly through Lume

(note:Since this is currently in raw markdown on github.io this [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#html) is going to be helpful.)

## here is my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-wolfson-6149a38/ "LinkedIn")

## here are things to do with pivoting to a Digital (Health) Tech Career
I have a [tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gVUXxEQxiFwOGSN3j87z4kNrJ43kaHIns3qNJZ93_lk/edit?usp=sharing) for my actions on this. (This one is staying private for now, but I'd like to get useful links up publicly for others to see.) 
### training and skills
 * [northcoders](https://northcoders.com/our-courses/coding-bootcamp): as for October 2023 I've completed the practice challenges for this and am waiting to book an entry challgene for the November 2023 Software Developmer bootcamp. 
 * [the coders guild](https://thecodersguild.org.uk/course-directory/#courses)
 * Generation UK
 * the [ddat capability framework](https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/) defines skills for different government roles at differnt levels
### Interesting companies for potential roles
 * 
### jobsearch resources
* https://superpower.tech/

### events (could/should this move to a json data file? I could then pressent reccent/upcoming only..)
* 29-30 November 2023, [Faculty of Clinical Informatics (FCI)](https://fci.org.uk/) are holding their [4th Annual Scientific Conference](https://fci.org.uk/events/fci-annual-scientific-conference-2023.html)
* 9-10 November 2023, Chester: [bcs](https://www.bcs.org/) have their [Primary Health Care SG Education day, AGM and 42nd Annual conference 2023](https://www.bcs.org/membership-and-registrations/member-communities/primary-health-care-specialist-group/conferences-and-events/phcsg-agm-and-annual-conference-2023/)
* 2nd November 2023, Leeds: [UK MedTech Innovation Assembly '23](https://halstongroup.co/events/medtech-innovation-assembly/)
* 14-15 October 2023, Leicester: There is an [NHS hackday](https://nhshackday.com/events/2023/10/leicester) but this is a weekend so probably won't fly... does the site have other events? it certainly has some good resources!
* a list of #ldf2023 events that I went to...
   * [no code](https://www.nocodelab.co.uk/) netzero hack
    * [communitas enercy CIC](Communitas Energy CIC) 
  * open innovates showcase had a load of good things
   * https://economic-analytics.shinyapps.io/Tax-Devolution/
   * https://www.inclusivegrowthleeds.com/leeds-social-progress-index
   * https://northernpowergrid.opendatasoft.com/
   * https://youthfuturesfoundation.org/toolkit/
   * https://www.cluetrain.com/
 

### organisations
 * [simple shared healthcare](https://www.simple.uk.net/)
 * [bitjam](https://bitjam.org.uk/)
 * [green software foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation/)

## here are interesting data projects in health that I'd like to do something about
 * I really like the work and approach that [Open Innovations](https://open-innovations.org/) do.
   * I'd like to emmulate their approach and technology stack in any training or personal projects that I do so [Luke Strange](https://open-innovations.org/search/?author=lstrange) was kind enough to point me to this overview of the [Open Innovations Platform](https://open-innovations.github.io/platform/)
   * Of particualr interest is the (Open Data Saves Lives) project.
   * I'd like to read more about the [open outcomes](ahttps://apperta.org/openOutcomes/) project as well. This may have some info under the [Apperta Foundation gitHub](https://github.com/AppertaFoundation), and the [Clinical Knowledge Manager /(CKM)](https://ckm.apperta.org/ckm/) also looks interesting.
   * can [news2](https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/projects/outputs/national-early-warning-score-news-2) parameters be usefully put into an app? Some of these are subjective, so digitising their definition might be useful. It'd take some validation though! 

### there was a lot of useful learning from #ldf2023, especially the hack at Aire Innovates 
 * [openEHR](https://openehr.org/) which [Ian McNicoll](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianmcnicoll/) told me about, in particualr, see the [specifications](https://specifications.openehr.org/) section.
 * [SNOMED](https://www.snomed.org/)
 * [UKCore Hackathon materials](https://simplifier.net/guide/UKCore-Hackathon/)
 * [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core)
   * https://simplifier.net/HL7FHIRUKCoreR4/~guides
   * https://simplifier.net/guide/uk-core-implementation-guide?version=current
 * [Florence](https://florence.community/) (or Flo) text message based system for home blood pressure reporting (Ian McNicoll also told me about this).
   * background on [NHS home bp monitoring)[https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/clinical-policy/cvd/home-blood-pressure-monitoring/] 
   * I'd be interested in understanding if this could flow directed to an EHR - this could become a #project
   * Also, could this be integrated into the NHS App
   * could one create an app to capture BP reading from a machine (home or clinical) and push this through? it should be possible to do this with fewer transposition errors, and could be impletmented with the hundreds of thousands of un-connected monitors already in hospitals, clinics and peoples homes...
   * there is a [paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2021.543176/full) that shows PoC for this, and has made their code available as [BPimageTranscribe repo](https://github.com/cliffordlab/BPimageTranscribe)

## and here are things to do with past career
### my PhD and research work
  * I did a PhD at University of Nottingham and my thesis on [on Biomechanics of shaken baby syndrome](https://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/11217/) is public so if you want you can read it if you like. To do all the processing of experimental data, and then automate running of computational models I built a RedHat Linux server, learned Perl and Python and then realised that my MATLAB code was so slow that I re-wrote it all in C++... I'm looking for examples of all that code on (very) old backup DVDs at the moment, but I suspect it is Fugly!
### [Past work in Medical Devices](medicalDevices.md)
### public information about work I did at DePuy Synthes, a Johnson & Johnson Company (now called Johnson & Johnson MedTech)

* https://www.jnjmedtech.com/en-US/product/attune-knee-system
* https://www.jnjmedtech.com/en-EMEA/products/attune-revision-knee-system
### and work the Biomet (now Zimmer Biomet)


## and finally, other things that interest me
### diversity and inclusion
