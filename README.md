A page to hold blog-like information and pointers to my career history and digital portfolio, hosted on [gitHub](https://github.com/WolfieKnee/).

| [career](medicalDevices.md) | [resume](resume.md) | [projects](projects.md) | [events](events.md) | [other interests](otherInterests.md) | [reading list](readingList.md) |
## my plan for this page:
a lot of this is inspired by [open innovations](https://open-innovations.org/)...
* when it is a bit more ready I should redirect my [personal url: davidwolfson.co.uk](davidwolfson.co.uk) to this, but for now it can stay pointing to [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-wolfson-6149a38/)
* add some style and structure, possibly through Lume. [Andy Bell's site](https://andy-bell.co.uk/) might be a good inspiration for this.

This [markdown guide]([https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#html](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)) is helpful.

## resources for getting going with general digital projects
 * a link to my own [gitHub](https://github.com/WolfieKnee/)
 * [MDM JS reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
 * [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
 * [code kata](http://codekata.com/)
 * Lume

 * JSON 

## here are things to do with pivoting to a Digital (Health) Tech Career
I have a [tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gVUXxEQxiFwOGSN3j87z4kNrJ43kaHIns3qNJZ93_lk/edit?usp=sharing) for my actions on this. (This one is staying private for now, but I'd like to get useful links up publicly for others to see.)
